# Java Core Code Repository

Welcome to the Java Core Code Repository! This repository is a collection of fundamental Java code examples, along with two test projects: FizzBuzz and Mortgage Calculator. Whether you are a beginner learning Java or an experienced developer looking for reference implementations, this repository aims to provide clear and concise examples.

## Java Core Codes

The `src` directory contains various Java core codes that cover essential concepts and functionalities. Each code file is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic, making it easy to understand and use as a reference. Topics covered include:

- Object-oriented programming (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction..etc)
- Data structures (e.g., arrays, lists)
- Exception handling
- File I/O
- Multithreading
- and more...

Feel free to explore the `src` directory to find examples relevant to your learning or development needs.

## FizzBuzz

The `FizzBuzz` directory contains a simple Java program that solves the classic FizzBuzz problem. This problem involves printing numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, "Fizz" is printed, for multiples of 5, "Buzz" is printed, and for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is printed.

Feel free to run and modify the FizzBuzz program to test your Java skills and explore different solutions.

## Mortgage Calculator

The `MortgageCalculator` directory includes a Java program that calculates monthly mortgage payments based on user input for loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. This project demonstrates basic input handling and mathematical calculations in Java.
